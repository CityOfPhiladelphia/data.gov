## Data.gov integration

A Node.js script that parses JSON from the [Open Data Philly API](http://opendataphilly.org/api-doc/) into a format that complies with the Common Core Metadata standards in [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/).

Generating a data.json file using this script will allow City of Philadelphia data to be incorproated into the [Cities community](http://www.data.gov/cities/Community/Cities/Datasets) in Data.gov
